The saved repository contains the test I performed in the HTML and CSS module.

I am coder Marx Engels Leal Brochero of the Sierra clan. My personal email is marximusleal568@mail.com and my personal ID is CC 1.151.472.436.
The uploaded repository consists of the creation of a store that sells laptops and desktop computers. It is structured into four different pages: home, about us, products, and contact. The website was created using HTML and CSS technologies. Each page has a header, main page, and footer structure. The header contains the navigation bar next to the store logo. The main page varies on each page; one greets the user with a photo and a message, one introduces the store team, one lists the available products, and finally, a contact me page.
